# A-BERT-based-Semantic-Enhanced-Model-for-Fake-News-Detection
During the COVID-19 outbreak, fake news spreads widely on the Internet, preventing authoritative information from spreading and hindering the fight against the disease. COVID-19 related news keeps growing daily and spreading on social media platforms in many forms, including text, pictures, and videos. To detect and recognize fake news, as well as to prevent its spread, effective detection models are urgently required. 
This study uses text as input and adds a topic extraction module to the BERT-based classifier, which takes the topics of the extracted data samples as new features to supplement the text representation.
